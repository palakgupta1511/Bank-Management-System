                          "Bank management system as well as ATM Simulator System"

The ATM Simulator System is a desktop application developed to simulate the functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM).It operates in a manner similar to a typical ATM. 

It was built using Java for the backend logic, Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI), and MySQL for database management. The system includes essential ATM functionalities such as user authentication, balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit, and transaction history.

If the user don't have account,they have to create their account first, only then they are able to use the functionality of this ATM System.

When a user initiates the application, they are prompted to log in using their unique account number and PIN. The system verifies the credentials by querying the MySQL database.

Upon successful authentication, the user is presented with a GUI built using Swing, displaying various options such as checking their account balance, withdrawing cash, depositing money, and viewing their transaction history. 

Each action interacts with the MySQL database to retrieve or update the necessary information, ensuring data integrity and real-time updates
